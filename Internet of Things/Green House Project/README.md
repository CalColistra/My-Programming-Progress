In this project I wrote code and built a circuit on the ESP32 to read temperature, humidity and light intensity.  It then uploads the data to a local website.  It is meant to be used as a device in a customer's greenhouse so they can monitor the conditions while they are away from the greenhouse.  It will also sound an alarm and turn on a blue (for cold) or red (for hot) LED light when the temperature goes too high or too low.
