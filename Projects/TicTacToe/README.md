This java program checks for Tic-Tac-Toe winners. The Tic-Tac-Toe boards are represented by 2D arrays of pieces. Each piece (P) can either be Empty, X, or O.

The tic_tac_crazy() function in TTT.java allows boards to have any size and the function is passed an integer (howMany) to decide how many X's or O's in a row are needed to be considered a win.
